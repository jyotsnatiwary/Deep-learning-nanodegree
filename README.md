# Deep-learning-nanodegree
Projects done durinng udacity deep learning nanodegree course.

  * Learnt everything about perceptron and refreshed numpy lib.
  * Implemented multiclassification and softmax
  * Implemented Softmax vs sigmoid and multiclass cross entropy.
  * Implemented a bike sharing pattern predictor.

   * Implemented autoencoder for compression, image de noising and dimensionality reduction.
   * Learnt how to use a pre trained network to extract content and style features from an image.
   * Implemented a dog breed classifier: built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, made important design decisions about the user experience for app.

   * Implemented a tv script generator project: generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. Used a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new, "fake" TV script.
   * Implemented a face generator: used generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

   * Deployed a sentiment analysis model.
   * Graduated from udacity in deep learning course
